# Quiz Project

> Quiz Website built using Django and Bootstrap


## About
---
This is a small website created to demonstrate what I've learned during Intel and Hack the Hood's 2021 Summer Internship. This was created using Django (Python web framework) and Bootstrap for styling. The short video below demonstrates how an admin user (Django's admin site) can easily add quiz questions and answers to the database and have them be displayed on the website.
